# DB - database interface

DB is a high level pluggable abstraction for databases. 

The motivation is to create a DBaaS layer that 
allows RPC based proxying so that we can leverage go-micro and all the plugins. This allows auth, 
rate limiting, tracing and all the other things to be used. What we lose in database drivers we gain 
in not having to write CRUD a thousand times over.

## Interface

Initial thoughts lie around a CRUD interface. The number of times 
one has to write CRUD on top of database libraries, having to think 
through schema and data modelling based on different databases is a 
pain. Going lower level than this doesn't pose any value.

Event sourcing can be tackled in a separate package.

```go
type DB interface {
        Init(...Option) error
        Options() Options
        Read(id string) (Record, error)
        Create(r Record) error
        Update(r Record) error
        Delete(id string) error
        Search(md Metadata, limit, offset int64) ([]Record, error)
        String() string
        // Potential expiremental in memory DB
        // needs to be started/stopped to be part of a ring
        // Also publishing to notify this is querying dbs
        Start() error
        Stop() error
}

type Option func(*Options)

type Metadata map[string]interface{}

type Record interface {
        Id() string
        Created() int64
        Updated() int64
        Metadata() Metadata
        Bytes() []byte
        Scan(v interface{}) error
}

func NewDB(opts ...Option) DB {
	return newPlatform(opts...)
}

func NewRecord(id string, md Metadata, data interface{}) Record {
	return newRecord(id, md, data)
}
```
