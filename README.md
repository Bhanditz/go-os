# Go Platform [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/micro/go-platform?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/micro/go-platform) [![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/micro/go-platform.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/micro/go-platform)

This is a microservice platform library built to be used with micro/go-micro. 
It provides all of the fundamental tooling required to run and manage 
a microservice environment. It's pluggable just like go-micro. It will be 
especially vital for anything above 20+ services and preferred by 
organisations. Developers looking to write standalone services should 
continue to use go-micro. 

Go platform depends on middleware/before-after funcs being added to 
go-micro. While each package can be used independently, it will be 
much more powerful as a whole.

Further community wide features should be contributed to [go-plugins](https://github.com/micro/go-plugins).

## Features
Each package provides a feature interface that will be pluggable and backed by a 
number of services.

## What's it even good for?

The Micro platform is useful for where you want to build a reliable globally distributed systems platform at scale. 
You would be in good company by doing so, with the likes of Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, Uber, Hailo, etc, etc.

## How does it work?

The go-platform is a client side interface for the fundamentals of a microservice platform. Each package connects to 
a service which handles that feature. Everything is an interface and pluggable which means you can choose how to 
architect your platform. Micro however provides a "platform" implementation backed by it's own services by default.

Each package can be used independently or integrated using go-micro client and handler wrappers.

### Auth 

Auth addresses authentication and authorization of services and users. The default implementation is Oauth2 with an additional policy 
engine coming soon. This is the best way to authenticate users and service to service calls using a centralised 
authority. Security is a first class citizen in a microservice platform.

### Config 

Config implements an interface for dynamic configuration. The config can be hierarchically loaded and merged from 
multiple sources e.g file, url, config service. It can and should also be namespaced so that environment specific 
config is loaded when running in dev, staging or production. The config interface is useful for business level 
configuration required by your services. It can be reloaded without needing to restart a service.

### DB (experimental) 

The DB interface is an experiment CRUD interface to simplify database access and management. The amount of CRUD boilerplate 
written and rewritten in a microservice world is immense. By offloading this to a backend service and using RPC, we 
eliminate much of that and speed up development. The platform implementation includes pluggable backends such as mysql, 
cassandra, elasticsearch and utilises the registry to lookup which nodes databases are assigned to. 

This is purely experimental at this point based on some ideas from how Google, Facebook and Twitte do database management 
internally.
 
### Discovery 

Discovery provides a high level service discovery interface on top of the go-micro registry. It utilises the watcher to 
locally cache service records and also heartbeats to a discovery service. It's akin to the Netflix Eureka 2.0 
architecture whereby we split the read and write layers of discovery into separate services.
